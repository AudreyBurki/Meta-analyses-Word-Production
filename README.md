# Meta-analyses-Word-Production

In cognitive psychology/experimental psychology, we often rely on experimental data to test our theories. Meta-analyses provide a summary of the empirical evidence available at a given point in time on a given effect. They are incredibly useful because they quantify the evidence on which we can build our next studies and theories. They also provide an idea of the size of an effect (how bit ig is) and of its precision. This can be used to run power analyses (analyses that help decide how many participants are needed to find an effect in a future experiment). 

In this project we performed meta-analyses of several important effects obtained with a variant of the stroop paradigm (i.e., name the color you see and ignore the name of a different color written on top). In this paradigm, participants name a picture and have to ignore a written word on the picture, as in the picture below.

We started this during the pandemic, when it was difficult to collect new data.
The overall picture seems to be that effects that have been reported early on seem to be real. However, evidence on moderators of these effects, which is crucial to disantangle existing theories of these effects, is often lacking.
