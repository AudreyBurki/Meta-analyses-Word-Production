# Meta-analyses-Word-Production

In cognitive psychology/experimental psychology, we often rely on experimental data to test our theories. Meta-analyses provide a summary of the empirical evidence available at a given point in time on a given effect. They are incredibly useful because they quantify the evidence on which we can build our next studies and theories. They also provide an idea of the size of an effect (how bit ig is) and of its precision. This can be used to run power analyses (analyses that help decide how many participants are needed to find an effect in a future experiment). 

In this project we performed meta-analyses of several effect that are often cited and have been used to build or constrain theories of word production processes.

Many of these effects were obtained with a variant of the stroop paradigm (i.e., name the color you see and ignore the name of a different color written on top). In this paradigm, participants name a picture and have to ignore a written word on the picture, as in the picture below.

The overall picture seems to be that
- Many of the effects reported early on are real. The figure belows shows the posterior distribution of the semantic interference effect (longer response times when naming a picture with a distractor word of the same semantic category).

- Many of the published studies have little power. The figure below shows an estimation of power for x studies


- Evidence on moderators of these effects, which is crucial to disantangle existing theories of these effects, is often lacking.
