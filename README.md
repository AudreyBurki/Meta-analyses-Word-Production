# Meta-analyses-Word-Production

In cognitive psychology/experimental psychology, we often rely on experimental data to test our theories. Meta-analyses provide a summary of the empirical evidence available at a given point in time on a given effect. They are incredibly useful because they quantify the evidence on which we can build our next studies and theories. They provide an idea of the size of an effect (how bit ig is) and of its precision. This can be used to run power analyses (analyses that help decide how many participants are needed to find an effect in a future experiment) and build more precise computational models.

## Syllable frequency effect (or why we are faster at saying bri than blo)
Words made of frequent syllables can be prepared faster for production than words made of low frequency syllables. THis effect has been used to argue that syllables are stored in the long ter
m memory of the speaker. We conducted a meta-analysis of this effect. The figure below shows the results of this analysis. This is a posterior distribution, it shows the most likely value of this effect (difference, in milliseconds between words with low and words with high syllable frequencies).

We see that most values are positive but also that this is a very small effect. The code and data to reproduce this analysis can be accessed [here](https://osf.io/4nmbj/)
